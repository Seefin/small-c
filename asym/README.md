# DO NOT USE THIS IN ANYTHING SERIOUS EVER

# KEYGEN

I wanna know how RSA works. This implements it.

# Invocation
```shell
keygen [OPTIONS] <key_file>
```

# Options
Currently supports four options:
 - -v: Show version information and quit
 - -h: Show help text and quit
 - -p: Create public key for supplied private key. Synonym of --private-key.
 - -c: Create public/private keypair and used supplied name as basename. Synonym of --create. If no name, default used.
